# FactoryCircuit

FactoryCircuit is a factory themed game that will operate on the Mina blockchain. Both the ownership of game assests and state settlements will be handled on the Mina network thus users will experience true asset ownership and decentralization on gameplay. Empowering the Mina blockchain, users can run their state changes based on the game rules on their local computers and later only proove it on the Mina network using ZK proofs. 

FactoryCircuit is aiming to become a continuous game where users can 
-   Build their strategies and earn coins continuously as they keep building proofs
-   Level up current components or build better strategies with earned coins 
-   Expand the area of their factories
-   Have social interactions, trade assets, cooperate and collide with each other

## Roadmap

### 1-) Demo
Currently the game is on demo stage it only has the basic game logic and runs on a local blockchain. It is the first step of the game's roadmap and aims to introduce the game to the Mina community.

### 2-) Gameplay

This step is about buidling the foundation of the game, deploying to the testnet and opening it to the users. It includes building the game as a ZK Rollup, designing the UI of the game, buidling the foundational game logic (leveling up components, having buildings by the roads which will have different benefits on coin amount per second), building a leaderboard for users to compete with each other and distributing prizes to top places on weekly bases.

### 3-) Game logic

This step will focus on building a logic with more features. At this stage there will be collabrations with game designers for adding more detailed features and build a wide range of opportunities for advanced strategic development. A forum for the game will be established where new and possible improvements will be disscussed among users and the builders of the game. Feature for expanding the factory area will be added which will contribute to the continuous improvement logic of the game.

### 4-) Trade, Cooperate and Collide

FactoryCircuit's social logic will be developed at this step. Users will be able to trade assets, make agreements among each others using smart contracts and collabrate or battle with each other for gaining assets.
